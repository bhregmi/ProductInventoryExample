# ProductInventoryExample
Product Inventory using Swift Vapor as a backend framework

First download and run this application as any other vapor app
create username and password using postman. Allow the application to access the local folder ( to create sqlite db)

Ex:
url POST:
  http://127.0.0.1:8080/users/signup
in the body:
{
	"username":"John",
	"password":"florida123"
}

You can use this username and password to login (use the ios app in another repo)

enter few records in the sqlite database such that you view them in the ios app.
